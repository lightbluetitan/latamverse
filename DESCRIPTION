Title: A Metapackage for Latin American Countries via RESTful APIs and Curated Datasets
Version: 0.1.0
Maintainer: Renzo Caceres Rossi <arenzocaceresrossi@gmail.com>
Description: A 'metapackage' that brings together a comprehensive collection 
    of R packages providing access to APIs functions and curated datasets from Argentina, Brazil, 
    Chile, Colombia, and Peru. It includes real-time and historical data through public 
    'RESTful' APIs ('Nager.Date', World Bank API, REST Countries API, and country-specific APIs) and 
    extensive curated collections of open datasets covering economics, demographics, public health, 
    environmental data, political indicators, social metrics, and cultural information. 
    Designed to provide researchers, analysts, educators, and data scientists with 
    centralized access to Latin American data sources, this 'metapackage' facilitates 
    reproducible research, comparative analysis, and teaching applications focused 
    on these five major Latin American countries.
    Included packages:
    - 'ArgentinAPI': APIs functions and curated datasets for Argentina covering exchange rates, inflation, political figures, national holidays and more.
    - 'BrazilDataAPI': APIs functions and curated datasets for Brazil covering postal codes, banks, economic indicators, holidays, company registrations and more.
    - 'ChileDataAPI': APIs functions and curated datasets for Chile covering financial indicators ('UF', UTM, Dollar, Euro, Yen, Copper, Bitcoin, 'IPSA' index), holidays and more.
    - 'ColombiAPI': APIs functions and curated datasets for Colombia covering geographic locations, cultural attractions, economic indicators, demographic data, national holidays and more.
    - 'PeruAPIs': APIs functions and curated datasets for Peru covering economic indicators, demographics, national holidays, administrative divisions, electoral data, biodiversity and more.
